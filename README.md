# BloopyCode: Advent of Code

Yet again another attempt to keep my [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/2015) attempts consistent and keep up the motivation. Initially in Python.

Pre-Challenge Goals: 
* Try with built-in packages and libraries only.
* Get to the end!
* Try in another language as well as Python.
